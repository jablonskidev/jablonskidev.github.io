<h2>About<a class="headerlink" href="#about" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I love working in <strong>developer education</strong> because I like code, words, and people.</p>
<p>I spend my time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using my <strong>programming</strong> knowledge and <strong>writing</strong> skills to be a bridge between developers and learners</p></li>
<li><p>Creating <strong>clear, helpful resources</strong> that are easy to navigate and enjoyable to use</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training</strong> my team members so that they can excel at their current projects and take on new ones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s help developers together.</p>

<h3>Python Tutorials<a class="headerlink" href="#python-tutorials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As the Executive Editor of <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a>, I have planned, written, reviewed, edited, and published <strong>over 300 tutorials</strong> about the Python programming language. Check out my <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/team/jjablonski/">profile at Real Python</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>I’ve also worked with subject matter experts to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Design <strong>learning paths</strong> that help learners progress in a way that is structured and effective</p></li>
<li><p>Plan our wider <strong>curriculum</strong> to make sure that it meets the varied needs of learners</p></li>

<h3>Python Books<a class="headerlink" href="#python-books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As the Executive Editor of Real Python, I’ve worked on books that have made a big impact on both <strong>beginner</strong> and <strong>advanced</strong> Pythonistas:</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4><a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/">Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I co-authored this book and did project management as I took it through the publishing process.</p>
<p>The first half is a quick but thorough overview of all the Python fundamentals. You don’t need any prior experience with programming to get started, and we’ll teach you everything you need to know, step-by-step.</p>
<p>The second half focuses on solving interesting, real-world problems with Python. Once you have the fundamentals down, you’ll progress quickly by following along with our hands-on coding exercises and projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4><a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I was one of two reviewers for this book aimed at advanced Pythonistas. I also did project management and took it through the publishing process.</p>
<p>With this book, you’ll cover the critical concepts behind the internals of CPython and see how they work with visual explanations and hands-on exercises.</p>
<p>Each page in this book has been carefully laid out with beautiful typography, syntax highlighting for code examples, and instructional illustrations so you can process and memorize the information effectively.</p>

<div class="section" id="python-s-official-documentation">
<h3>Python’s Official Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#python-s-official-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Documentation is important.</strong> If your documentation is the first point of contact that potential users have with your project, then it has a big job to do. It needs to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make learning easy for your users</p></li>
<li><p>Pitch your product</p></li>
<li><p>Build trust</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I want documentation in open source to be better, and I love the Python community, so I regularly contribute documentation to Python. I’ve learned a lot in the process, and it’s gotten me into <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a>, which I used to make this page.</p>

<div class="section" id="education">
<h2>Education<a class="headerlink" href="#education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I love <strong>natural languages</strong> just as much as I love <strong>programming languages</strong>, and that shows in my formal education as well as my self-directed learning. I’m usually taking some kind of course on something that I’m curious about.</p>
<p>Here are some of the courses that I’ve found most useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7?index=product&amp;queryID=317d1c5a1113097ed99ca72e9b7c2790&amp;position=2">6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introducing-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing-with-python?index=product&amp;queryID=4a02cba71814761e3eaded80d27890b5&amp;position=1">LNG01.1ucx: Introducing Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing with Python</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/programming-for-the-web-with-javascript?index=product&amp;queryID=f0d2e1088808626a98f6cb7e686a85c2&amp;position=1">SD4x: Programming for the Web with JavaScript</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/html5-and-css-fundamentals?index=product&amp;queryID=61fd963f47717b135ed5200457f98e84&amp;position=1">HTML5.0x: HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux?index=product&amp;queryID=1eb80855a985378ef3ef697bd9b4811a&amp;position=1">LFS101x: Introduction to Linux</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/agile-software-development?index=product&amp;queryID=631e528807cd68dda3bb7fb8ea1d838d&amp;position=1">ASD.1x: Agile Software Development</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also interested in information architecture and found the book <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/">Information Architecture: For the Web and Beyond</a> quite useful.</p>
<p>Before I was working in developer education, I worked in <strong>translation</strong>, which is what I studied at university. As a result, I:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Value <strong>written communication</strong> that is clear, accurate, and appropriate for its context</p></li>
<li><p>Have experience navigating the nuances of <strong>cross-cultural communication</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, I’ve found that translation and software development are quite similar. They’re both puzzles that require you to say exactly what you mean, no more no less.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbreuss/">Martin Breuss</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Lead Python Instructor and Head of Curriculum Development at Coding Nomads</em></p>
<p>I greatly appreciate learning from Joanna while contributing to the technical tutorials published at Real Python. She has an impressive understanding of the bigger-picture learning needs of the Python community. Joanna consistently re-assesses curricula and steers the content creation at Real Python in the best possible direction. She is also the driving force behind the high-quality pedagogical and writing standards at Real Python and is helping a large and growing base of technical writers to improve their skills and general quality of work.</p>
<p>Joanna is able to do all this not only because of her background as a linguist, language professional, editor, and team leader but also because of her own technical skills as a Python programmer.</p>
<p>Joanna’s comprehensive understanding of the field regularly informs my own decisions regarding consistent quality for pedagogic content in programming education. The Real Python team has a wide reach and high-profile authors, and Joanna’s consistently excellent and insightful feedback to them means that her direction improves the writing standards for technical content on software development far beyond the resources at Real Python.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/burgaud/">André Burgaud</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Sr. Manager, Development at SPS Commerce</em></p>
<p>I have known Joanna for the past two years since I started writing articles for Real Python. Joanna has been my leader (editor, project manager, trainer, publisher…) to plan and successfully deliver the Python tutorials that I wrote.</p>
<p>Her talents go far beyond editing articles. Joanna handles the tasks of recruiter, mentor, publisher, writer, teacher, trainer, and leader. When you work with Joanna you are in good hands, you can follow her guidance and focus on your writing.</p>
<p>She has been a driving force behind the success of Real Python. I have learned a lot under Joanna’s coaching and she has changed forever the way I approach writing.</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for what she does and who she is, and I remain impressed by her multiple talents.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimander/">Jim Anderson</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Senior Firmware Architect at Motorola Solutions</em></p>
<p>In my work with Joanna at Real Python, she has reviewed and edited several of articles I’ve been involved with.  In each of them she’s brought a high level of skill to the job, both in the technical and the editorial sense.</p>
<p>While her abilities to thoughtfully and tactfully address issues of grammar and tone are excellent, the biggest benefit the team gains is from her leadership. Joanna is part of the core or a large and far-flung group of editors, writers and artists who come together to make an excellent product for our readers. She has led by example, showing patience, kindness, and tact while delivering feedback in all forms.</p>
<p>I have personally learned a great deal from Joanna, not only about writing and grammar, but also about team-building and communication.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronquilloalex/">Alex Ronquillo</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Product Language Writer at New Relic, Inc.</em></p>
<p>It is a privilege to work with Joanna on my articles at Real Python. She is a humble leader, providing a knowledgeable voice of guidance while often asking us authors for our opinions on how she can improve her processes. She’s helpful, a great communicator, and dedicates herself to her craft.</p>
<p>One of her greatest strengths is her trust in her team. She is responsible with her task delegation and empowers authors, editors, and reviewers with opportunities.</p>
<p>I am a better author, reviewer, developer, and leader because of Joanna. She inspires me to be a better contributor to Real Python and every team I’m part of.</p>

<p><em>Senior Open Source Advocate (Python and Cloud) at Microsoft</em></p>
<p>Joanna is a rare talent. She has an uncanny ability to analyse complex technical writing, coach the writing team, and put the whole team in the shoes of the reader. All of the content on Real Python that Joanna has been involved with editing has such a high standard, you can tell by reading it whether Joanna was involved. I’ve learnt a lot from Joanna over the years.</p>
